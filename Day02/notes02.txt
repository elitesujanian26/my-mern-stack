Theory

Creating Index.html File =>


Use case of Index.html => What problem does is

whenever you are requesting a server => 
you are going to create a https connection first
so, from the client side you are going to send a http request to a server 
then you will do a three way handshake.
after 3-way handshake client side comes to know that data is coming from ab authentic source.

now, if client say  let me go to www.facebook.com but facebook.com pe jaane ke baad page kaunsa display hoga.
to solve this issue we have something known as index.html
first name is going to index extension can js , php , html


client ne kuch request kre data ke liye server se
server ne respond back kra
Now the asyncronous term will come here.
client ne req bheji or in return client ko server se respond kiya 
Client server model exist . Why? =>
because bahut saara hidden data,business logic hota hai jisko client ko mtlb nhi hota so server kind off creates a absraction around business logic which is called server side coding.

what is Server?
laptop mein jo hardware hai, vo hi hardware server mein hai
8 Gb Ram
OS => Operating System
User managemement 
or basic other requirements hai laptop ki vo hi server ki requirements hain

server connect kr ke dikhenge AWS ka. taki hum deply kr sakhein production mein cheezein.

Why CDN server is fast? =>
because CDN server uses cache memory(5mb - 32mb). Cache is the fastest form of memory. cache ke fast koi memory nhi hai or bahut easily acces hota hai Cpu ko cache ka bahut jaldi respnse aata hai.
CDN kabhi bhi ek server pe nhi chal rha hota hai, vo multple server pe chalta hai.


Asyncronous

Hum Top Down Approach follow krtein hai jab bhi HTML ka page aata hai. line by line render.
